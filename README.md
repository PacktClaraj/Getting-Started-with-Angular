## About the Video Course
Angular is the modern framework you need to build performant and robust web applications. This video is the quickest way to upgrade your AngularJS knowledge to the brave new world of Angular, and get to grips with the framework. It starts with an overview, putting the changes of the framework into the context of version 1. After that, you will be taken on a TypeScript crash-course so you can take advantage of Angular in its native, statically-typed environment. You'll explore the new change detection mechanism in detail, how directives and components have changed, how you create applications with Angular, and much more. Next, you'll understand how to efficiently develop forms, use the router, implement communication with HTTP services, and transform data with custom pipes. Finally, we take a look at Angular's Ahead-of-Time compiler; angular-cli, and other such tools that help us build professional applications. By the end of the book, you'll be ready to start building quick and efficient Angular applications compatible with Angular 2 and Angular 4. This video is up-to-date for the Angular 4 release and is compatible through with the 5.0 release as well.
